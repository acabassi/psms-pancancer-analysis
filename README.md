# Pan-cancer analysis

The code contained in this folder can be used to reproduce the pancancer analysis presented in Cabassi, Richardson, and Kirk (in preparation). The data used for the analysis are those of Hoadley et al. (2014), which can be downloaded from [Synapse](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2468297/wiki/64259). The links to each dataset can be found at the beginning of the R scripts where needed.
